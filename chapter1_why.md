# Why study neural mechanisms?

Studying neural mechanisms is a complicated process, so we should know why we would want to do that and what the outcome could be useful for.

## Curiosity!
The first intrinsic motivation is because we might simply be curious as to how our brain manages to create our mind and control our behaviour.

## Therapy / improvement
Can help to find treatment of deficits, or improve life quality of healthy people.

### Examples:  
- Medical diagnostics: communication with lock-in patient to determine consciousness  
- Neural plasticity: taxi drivers; meditation->DSL PFC act increase -> explains why TMS works   
- Help to choose medication (?)  

### Short-term
support of psychotherapeutic interventions (neurofeedback)

### Long-term
1. development of new drugs
→ measure of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics → changed fMRI after drug intervention
