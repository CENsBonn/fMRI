# Where can I get data?

Thanks to the formation of common data acquisition projects and the 
popularization of data sharing through repositories, more and more high-quality datasets can be accessed online.

```{Note}
Data to download are often in BIDS format, which is explained [here](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
```

## Datasets and repositories:
- Human Connectome Project: https://www.humanconnectome.org/
- [7T natural scenes dataset](http://naturalscenesdataset.org); see the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00962-x)
- BOLD responses to>1000 3s-videos with metadata: [Bold moments](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.12.530887v1.full.pdf)
- General repositories: [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/), [NeuroVault](https://neurovault.org/)
- More fMRI data on [academictorrents](https://academictorrents.com/browse.php?search=fmri)

## Automated meta-analyses
- The most famous is [NeuroSynth](https://neurosynth.org/)

## A special kind of neuroimaging: people watching movies (naturalistic imaging)
- [Naturalistic data](https://naturalistic-data.org)
