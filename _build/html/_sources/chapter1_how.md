# How can we study neural mechanisms?
Many methods have been used to investigate brain functions. Starting from studies of the effects of human brain lesions resulting from accidents, war injuries or stroke, techniques have multiplied and increased in sophistication.

## Measurement of brain activity
These techniques record some measure of brain activity or a derivate measure, but do not allow to modify this activity.

### Electric signals
Neurons communicate by sending electric signals, so recording electric activity
allows to obtain detailed information about what neurons respond to.  
1. Patch-clamp recording  
2. Single unit recordings  
3. Electrophysiological recordings  
4. Calcium imaging, incl. 2-photon imaging  
5. Local field potential recordings (extracellular)  
6. EEG  
7. MEG

### Metabolic signals
These techniques collect indirect measures of brain activity, such as its metabolic consequences.  
1. PET  
2. fMRI (note: different applications of MRI allow to measure other things than brain activity: DTI, DWI, spectroscopy)  
3. fNIRS  
4. Functional ultrasound  

## Influencing brain activity
These techniques allow to modify brain activity.  
1. TMS  
2. Optogenetics  
3. Cooling  
4. Muscimol
