    "# Why study neural mechanisms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying neural mechanisms is a complicated process, so we should know why we would want to do that and what the outcome could be useful for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Curiosity!\n",
    "The first intrinsic motivation is because we might simply be curious as to how our brain manages to create our mind and control our behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Therapy / improvement\n",
    "Can help to find treatment of deficits, or improve life quality of healthy people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:  \n",
    "- Medical diagnostics: communication with lock-in patient to determine consciousness  \n",
    "- Neural plasticity: taxi drivers; meditation->DSL PFC act increase -> explains why TMS works   \n",
    "- Help to choose medication (?)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term\n",
    "support of psychotherapeutic interventions (neurofeedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term\n",
    "1. development of new drugs\n",
    "→ measure of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics → changed fMRI after drug intervention"
