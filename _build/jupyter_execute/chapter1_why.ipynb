    "# Why study neural mechanisms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying neural mechanisms is a complicated process, so we should know why we would want to do that and what the outcome could be useful for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Curiosity!\n",
    "The first intrinsic motivation is because we might simply be curious as to how our brain manages to create our mind and control our behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Therapy / improvement\n",
    "Can help to find treatment of deficits, or improve life quality of healthy people. However, concrete evidence of that is still scarce at present.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:  \n",
    "- Medical diagnostics: [fMRI can be used to communicate with a patient in a vegetative state to determine their consciousness level](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0905370); [works with fNIRS as well](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.NPh.4.4.040501)\n",
    "- MRI can reveal evidence of neural plasticity in adults, such as: [increase in hippocampus volume due to navigation training in taxi drivers](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.070039597](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.070039597); [increase in hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume, and changes in navigation strategy, after playing a video game for 2 months]([https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.120](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.120). [However, a recent randomized control study showed no significant change in gray matter as a result of an 8-week mindfulness training](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abk3316)\n",
    "- While [neuroimaging cannot help to diagnose classically-defined psychiatric diseases](https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.1750701), it can help the differential diagnosis by [excluding potential causes of psychiatric symptoms](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00276)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term\n",
    "Neuroimaging can support psychotherapeutic interventions through neurofeedback; for example, [people can learn to modulate the response in their amygdala through neurofeedback](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104694). Whether neurofeedback really improves the impact of psychotherapeutic interventions appears however to still be unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term\n",
    "1. development of new drugs\n",
    "→ measure of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics → changed fMRI after drug intervention"
