# How can I analyse data?

Thanks to the formation of common data acquisition projects and the 
popularization of data sharing through repositories, more and more high-quality datasets can be accessed online.

```{Note}
Data to download are often in BIDS format, which is explained [here](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
```

## Analysis tutorials for classic, regression-based analyses

- Detailed instructions about how to run such analyses with SPM, FReeSurfer, FSL: [Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Complete fMRI course, includes theory and detailed instructions about analyses in Python: [DartBrains](https://DartBrains.org).

## Analysis tutorials for naturalistic (movie) fMRI datasets

- A website with detailed tutorials about how to analyse movie data: [Naturalistic data](https://naturalistic-data.org).
- A platform for fast and flexible re-analysis of (naturalistic) fMRI studies, with 13 datasets and downloadable code: [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/datasets); see also this [paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79277).
