# Welcome to the Human Neuroimaging web resource

This is an online resource to teach students and researchers about how to study human brain activity, focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in particular.
  
The aim is to provide a collection of lecture notes and links to online content that should allow interested people with a laptop and time to learn about and perform publishable neuroimaging research for free.  

The site builds on recent developments in human neuroimaging practices and the proliferation of online resources and open source software. 

The site is a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) inspired by the [DartBrains](https://dartbrains.org) fMRI course at Dartmouth University,
created during the Social Neuroscience course of the Masters in Neuroscience program at the University of Bonn's [Center for Economics and Neuroscience](https://www.cens.uni-bonn.de), by the 2023 class of students and staff ([Dr. Johannes Schultz](https://www.cens.uni-bonn.de/en/schultz-johannes-pd-dr)). The content was written in MyST Markdown and generated using Jupyter-Book v0.15.0.
